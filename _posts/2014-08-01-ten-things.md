## Ten things every software team needs to be successful

1. Source Configuration Management (SCM) software; preferrably [git](http://git-scm.com/)
2. A decent branching [strategy](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
3. Code conventions enforced with a linter; see [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/), [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) or [OCLint](http://oclint.org/)
4. Automated unit tests
5. Continuous integration that runs on every commit
6. A staging environment for testing
7. Server side error reporting and alerting; see [Airbrake](https://airbrake.io/) or [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/)
8. Application monitoring and graphing (OS-level if you can); see [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) or [StatHat](http://www.stathat.com/)
9. Fast, zero downtime deploys
10. Project management software; see [PivotalTracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/) or [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
