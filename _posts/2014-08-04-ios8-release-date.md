I think it's safe to say that Apple is following last year's roadmap and we can expect one more beta build before a Golden Master (GM) event in early September. And new iPhone(s) at the end of the month.

Expect a new build of Xcode in two weeks with some more Swift hotness.

*UPDATE:* Apple has scheduled a big media event for Tuesday, September 9th.
